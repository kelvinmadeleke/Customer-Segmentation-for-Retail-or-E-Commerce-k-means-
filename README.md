# Customer-Segmentation-for-Retail-or-E-Commerce-k-means-


This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering to analyze customer behavior in a retail or e-commerce setting. The dataset consists of transaction details, including Country, Quantity, UnitPrice, and Recency.

Objective
The objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their transaction behaviors. By clustering customers using K-Means, we can identify patterns that help businesses target specific customer groups effectively.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: We start by loading the transaction data and normalizing the features such as Quantity, UnitPrice, and Recency. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process.

Clustering: K-Means clustering is applied to group the customers into 4 clusters based on the selected features. The number of clusters is determined by the elbow method, where the optimal value for k is chosen to minimize within-cluster variance.

Visualization: To better understand the clusters, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used to reduce the features to two dimensions. A scatter plot is generated to visualize how customers are distributed across the clusters.

Analysis: The characteristics of each cluster are analyzed by calculating the mean values of the features (Quantity, UnitPrice, Recency) within each cluster. This helps identify the behavioral patterns of each customer segment.

Code Snippets
The following Python libraries were used:

Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models, including K-Means clustering and PCA.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Conclusion
The results of the clustering can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer engagement based on the distinct characteristics of each cluster. Understanding customer segmentation is a critical aspect of enhancing business decisions in retail and e-commerce.
